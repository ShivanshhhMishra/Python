l = [1, "Shivansh", False, "This", "Rohan", "Shubham", "Shubhi"]


i = 0

while (i<len(l)):
  print(l[i])
  i +=1


  # So there is a list we have to print, we does this by applying loop on it, we intialize the loop with i = 0, then we give the condition i<len(), this len(l) means it count the toatal length of  list >(l), according to that it runs the till the final count,In this case we have  7 elements in list, so that itrate till 7 and then it will stop.
